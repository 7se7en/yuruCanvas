Program made with DeepSeek-R1 (AI)

Just posting online to maybe share with others. Though as complexity increases, so does the inefficiency. As is the nature with a fully-AI-created program.

# What is it?

Blank canvas where you can create text bubbles and then link them together with directional arrows

# How to run

Requires Python and tkinterdnd2 to have access to drag and drop load functionality

`pip install tkinterdnd2`

# How to use

* Double Click : Add new bubble
* Left Click and Drag : Move bubble around
* Right Click and Drag to another Bubble: Connect to bubbles together with a line
* Double Click on Bubble -> Edit -> Toggleable : Makes a bubble function as a switch that shows/hide its connection lines, bubbles connected to it, and those bubbles' connection lines

# Quick Way to Load files

Drag .JSON files onto the .pyw file in the folder itself, or into the canvas while the program is open, to quickly load files.
