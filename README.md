# How to run

Requires Python and tkinterdnd2 to have access to drag and drop load functionality

`pip install tkinterdnd2`

# How to use

* Double Click : Add new bubble
* Left Click and Drag : Move bubble around
* Right Click and Drag to another Bubble: Connect to bubbles together with a line
* Right Click, Drag, Release on same Bubble : Open context menu (very jank, trying to fix)

# Quick Way to Load files

Drag .JSON files onto the .pyw file in the folder itself, or into the canvas while the program is open, to quickly load files.
